## Help Needed In
If you want to help but don't know where to start:

* Code quality feedback and proposals
* TODOs
* Usability improvements

Feel free to propose any ideas related to architecture, guide (___docs are never complete___),  adaptation or community.

> Original guide author is not native English speaker, feel free to create PR for any text corrections.

## Guide Improvements
If you feel like some "sugar" functionality (like shortcuts, constructor saturation or autowiring) can cause potential issues in future or reduce code testability please let me know so i can update guide and mention about potential architecture decisions or workarounds.

> If you find the documentation lacking in certain areas - arhitectural wise or typos -, please create a issue on [Github](https://github.com/spiral/spiral) or better still a pull request containing the improvements.
