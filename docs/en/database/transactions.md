# Transactions
Both Database and Driver instances provide access to transaction management for your queries.
You can manage transactions manually or use pre-created Closure based flow.

## Examples
To start and commit transaction manually use `begin` and `commit` methods of Database:
```php
$this->db->begin();
//Your queries
$this->db->commit();
```

Rollback:

```php
$this->db->begin();
//Your queries
$this->db->rollback();
```

## Alternative Approach
You can let Database manage state of your transaction automatically using `transaction` method:

```php
$this->db->transaction(function (Database $db) {
    //Queries    
});
```

> Transaction will be rolled back in case of any exception.
