# Forms: Datepicker

UI component for autocomplete in forms

They are located in the toolkit bundle, that can be included like so:

```xhtml
<use:bundle path="toolkit:bundle"/>
```

This is also automatically included when using

```xhtml
<use:bundle path="keeper:bundle"/>
```

See [Usage Samples](https://github.com/spiral/app-keeper/blob/master/app/views/keeper/showcase/datepicker.dark.php) in
the demo repository

## Native date picker form:date

```xhtml
<form:date
        name="date"
        label="Native Date Picker"
        value=""
        size="6"
/>
```

It renders a native `type=date` element with no additional functionality or extended browser support

## JavaScript date picker form:date-js

```xhtml
<form:date-js
        name="date1"
        label="Date"
        value="2020-10-29T14:14:14+0300"
        size="6"
/>
```

It renders a JS powered datepicker with extended
functionality. [Format tokens](https://moment.github.io/luxon/docs/manual/formatting.html#table-of-tokens) are inherited
